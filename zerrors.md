# Quizme

## Features so far
1. User authentication
2. User generates questions (using question type, number of questions, difficulty level)
3. User saves questions with name

## Errors to tackle
+ Error parsing generated questions
+ Where we send the dummy questions, we should send something else.
+ Alert dialog should come only when questions have been generated successfully
